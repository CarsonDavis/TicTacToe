# Methodology
This data was generated by having the computer play itself in various configurations.

All games resulting in a victory of either player were kept. Of those games, only moves made by the winner were kept as training data.

Smart vs Random: 40k - kept all wins from both players - Wins: 38916 | 429 | 655

Random vs Smart: 40k - kept all wins from both players- Wins: 5962 | 33875 | 163

Random vs Random: 20k - kept all wins from both players - Wins: 11585 | 5900 | 2515

# Old Model vs New Model

Smart v Old: 10000 | 0 | 0
Olv v Smart: 10000 | 0 | 0

# Problems and Next Steps

These results seem functionally identical to the model trained only on random vs random games. 

I think the next step is to gather data from games where the model loses to a random player. Use those games as 50% of the next training data.git
