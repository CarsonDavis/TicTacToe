# Methodology
This data was generated by having the computer play itself using random moves 25,000 times.

Only games won by player 1 were kept. Of those games, only moves made by player 1 were kept.

# Problems and Next Steps

A perfect model used by the second player should always result in a  draw or a win. So although this model does better
than chance, it is not prefect yet. 

As expected, when the model plays itself, it plays an identical game 25,000 times. However, that game should have been a tie.

To address these issues, I am going to remake a new baseline data set with a record of the winning moves from all games, not just Player 1's. 

I'm not sure I should train on tie games. I think a player playing to win will tie or win. So my instict is to not use them for training.
